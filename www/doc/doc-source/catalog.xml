    <para>The dotLRN-Catalog package make use of various packages like
    acs-content-repository, categories, assessment dotLRN. It makes use of
    acs-content-repository API to create the data-table and store the data in
    the database. It is designed to provide professors a way to create courses
    that can have different versions (revisions) and than can be associated to
    dotLRN classes and communities, categorized in different categories, and
    also associate one assessment that will provide a way to the users to
    register to the system, enroll to different dotlrn classes, make member of
    communities, etc.</para>

      <para>The basic table that has all the information about dotlrn-catalog
      courses is:</para>

      <para>The new content_type and attribute table are created with the

      <title>Content Folder</title>

      <para>To store the the courses in the Content Repository, a
      content-folder with name and label "DotLRN Catalog" was created. Also
      the previously created content_type is registered to the folder, by
      calling to the same after-install apm-callback-proc as follows:</para>

      <programlisting>
      set folder_id [content::folder::new -name "DotLRN Catalog" -label "DotLRN Catalog"]

    <section>
      <title>Roles</title>

      <para>Three new roles were created to use them when creating the
      relations. The first one is for the dotlrn-catalog course and it's
      called d_catalog_role, the second one is for the dotlrn class and it's
      called dotlrn-class_role and the last one is for the dotlrn communities
      and it's called dotlrn_com_role. This roles are the first thing that the
      package create on installation and their creation code is:</para>

      <title>Relations</title>

      <para>Two new relations were created to associate dotlrn classes and
      communities to dotlrn-catalog courses. On associates the dotlrn_catalog
      type with dotlrn_class_instance type for dotlrn classes, and the other
      one associates the dotlrn_catalog type with dotlrn_club for the
      communities. Here is were the previous created roles take place:</para>

      <programlisting># To associate one course to dotlrn 
      class rel_types::new -role_one d_catalog_role \
                           -role_two dotlrn_class_role dotlrn_catalog_class_rel \

    <section>
      <title>Privileges</title>

      <para>Two privileges are managed in this package at different levels,
      one is the privilege that a user has over dotlrn-catalog package (admin,
      create, none), and the other one the privilege that the user has over
      one dotlrn-catalog course (admin,none). Depending of what privilege the
      users has, access to some pages and the display of information will be
      different. For example if you you have admin or create privilege over
      dotlrn-catalog package then you can access to every page under the
      "dotlrn-catalog/dt-catalog/" url, if you are admin all courses will be
      shown there but if you only have create privilege the only your courses
      will be show. When you create one course then the admin privilege will
      be granted to you over that course (item_id). There are two ways to
      grant permission to other users at the same two levels described before.
      The admin of dotlrn-catalog package can grant/revoke other users the
      create privilege over the package, and, any user can grant admin
      privilege over one of his courses to any other user in the
      system.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Category Tree</title>

      <para>The package installation also mounts an instance of itself under
      the dotlrn-catalog url, here another amp-callback-proc is called
      (after-mount) to create the category tree that will allow to categorize
      each course in different ways. The category tree is created as
      follows:</para>

      <programlisting># To categorize courses 
      set tree_id [category_tree::add -name "dotlrn-course-catalog"] 
      category_tree::map -tree_id $tree_id -object_id $package_id -assign_single_p "t"
      </programlisting>

  <chapter>
    <title>USERS MANUAL</title>

    <para>Here are some simple statements to interact with the dotlrn-catalog
    package. For sections 2.1 to 2.6 the user requires to have create or admin
    privileges under the dotlrn-catalog, package. If you can see the Admin
    link in the top right corner of the page then you have privileges on the
    dotlrn-package. If you can't see it then you may be interested in Simple
    Users Section</para>

    <section>
      <title>Manage Category Tree</title>

      <para>Once you click to admin link then you will be redirected to your
      course list page, where if you are dotlrn-catalog admin or
      site-wide-admin then the link Manage Category Tree will appear:</para>
